### Coursera Notebook (In progress)

**This is an R notebook of work I've been putting together** while working on doing the [Bioinformatics Algorithm MOOC by Compeau & Pevzner](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/bioinformatics). I would highly recommend this course! It covers a lot of interesting topics, including: 

  +  motif-finding
  +  sequence alignment
  +  phylogeny
  +  clustering
  +  peptide indentification from mass-spectra
