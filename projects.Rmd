### Cou
*This is an R notebook of work I've put together* while working on doing the [Bioinformatics Algorithm MOOC by Compeau & Pevzner](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/bioinformatics). I would highly recommend this course! It covers a lot of interesting topics, including: 

  +  motif-finding
  +  sequence alignment
  +  phylogeny
  +  clustering
  +  peptide indentification from mass-spectra


This is a gallery of some figures ~ until I get something more structured ready for this page
