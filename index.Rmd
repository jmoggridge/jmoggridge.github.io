## About me
  
       
  Currently enrolled in the Master of Bioinformatics program at University of Guelph (2020-2021). Interested in next-generation sequencing and designing algorithms. I really enjoy solving bioinformatics coding challenges on [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/users/jasonmoggridge/).    
  
  During my undergrad at Carleton, I spent three summers doing biochemistry & molecular biology research under the supervision of [Dr. Ken Storey](http://www.kenstoreylab.com/ken-storey/). My undergrad research initially focused on developing assays for protein stability using a real-time PCR instrument; in my upper years and for my Honours thesis, I investigated changes in microRNA expression during hibernation in the Monito del monte (*Dromiciops gliroides*) and in response to dehydration stress in the African clawed frog (*Xenopus laevis*).
  
  Lives in Ottawa. Enjoys cycling, cross-country skiing and exploring natural areas around the city. Favourite TV shows are *Nathan For You* and *Freaks and Geeks*. I have two cats.
  
  <!-- Other things I used to do: Lifeguard at Lac Lapêche (2001), Lived in New Zealand (2001-200)   -->

## Projects  
  
<br>

### *Ottawa bike counters dashboard*
  
   An interactive dashboard surveying nearly 10 years of municipal bike counter data from 13 different locations in Ottawa, ON. 
   Readers can analyze and compare various aspects of each time series including: seasonality, autocorrelation and decomposition; effect of weather variables on traffic; and correlation between counts at different locations. 
   I am currently developing a seasonal+trend forecasting model for future years.

### *Ottawa Beaches water quality dashboard*
    
   A dashboard exploring beach water quality data from five public beaches in Ottawa during 2014-2019. Dynamic visualizations of paired observations of *E. coli* counts and beach status. Includes analysis of *E.coli* count distributions by year, time of year, and location. The dashboard will eventually include graphs of interactions between *E.coli* counts, weather and river conditions and their predictive utility in beach water monitoring. Going forward, I would like to implement a 'nowcasting' model to augment the current persistence model for closures based on these relationships.
