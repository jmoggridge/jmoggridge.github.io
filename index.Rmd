## Projects
  
<br>    
  
### *#OttBike Counters dashboard*

   An interactive dashboard surveying nearly 10 years of municipal bike counter data from 13 different locations in Ottawa, ON. 
   Readers can analyze and compare various aspects of each time series including: seasonality, autoregression and decomposition; effect of weather variables on traffic; and clustering of locations by similarity. I am interested in developing a predictive model for future years using time series forecasting methods like *exponential smoothing* or *autoreggresive integrated moving average*.

### *Ottawa Beaches Water Quality Dashboard*
    
   A dashboard exploring beach water quality data from five public beaches in Ottawa during 2014-2019. Dynamic visualizations of ~two thousand paired observations of *E. coli* counts and beach status. Includes analysis of E.coli count distributions by year, time of year, and location. The dashboard will eventually include graphs of interactions between E.coli counts, weather and river conditions and their predictive utility in beach water monitoring. Going forward, I hope to produce forecasting models to augment the current persistence model for closures based on these relationships. Similar systems are employed by NowCast for beaches in Ohio and elsewhere.

## About me
       
  Graduate student most interested in next-generation sequencing and string algorithms for applications in molecular biology, biochemistry, genetics. Lives in Ottawa. Enjoys cycling ([follow me on Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/17492854)), cross-country skiing and exploring natural areas around the city. Favourite TV shows are *Nathan For You* and *Freaks and Geeks*. I have two cats. Challenge me to a game of chess on [Lichess](https://lichess.org/@/JasonMoggridge).
