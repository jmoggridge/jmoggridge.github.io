### Ottawa Beaches

[Ottawa Beaches Water Quality Dashboard](https://jmoggridge.shinyapps.io/OttawaBeaches/)
  
   A dashboard exploring beach water quality data from five public beaches in Ottawa during 2014-2019. This is a project that started on a whim because  I wanted to learn to make a dashboard in R using Shiny and dashboards are so hot right now.  
  The city has made the data public, however I couldn't find any good visualizations of the entire set of two thousand paired observations (*E. coli* count, beach status).  It seemed like it would be useful to anyone interested in the beaches' water quality to provide some good visualizations from this dataset in it's entirety.  
    Ultimately, I hope to turn this larger project beyond the dashboard; I am working on a predictive tool to augment the current persistence model for water quality-related closures. If the model proves accurate, I hope to write a paper/proposal about implementing it in the future.
