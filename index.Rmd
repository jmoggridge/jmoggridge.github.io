### Ottawa Beaches

[Ottawa Beaches Water Quality Dashboard](https://jmoggridge.shinyapps.io/OttawaBeaches/)
  
   A dashboard exploring beach water quality data from five public beaches in Ottawa during 2014-2019. This is a project that started on a whim because  I wanted to learn to make a dashboard in R using Shiny and dashboards are so hot right now.

   I chose to present the City of Ottawa beach water quality and closures data because I saw a fairly influencial person (by local Ottawa standards) arguing about beach water quality on twitter. The city provides all the historic data back to 2014 to the public, but I couldn't find any good visualizations of the two thousand paired observations (*E. coli* count, beach status).  It seemed like it would be useful to anyone interested in the beaches' water quality to provide some good data viz from this dataset.  
    Ultimately, I hope this turns into a larger project; I am busy preparing a proposal for a predictive tool to augment the current persistence model for water quality-related closures.
