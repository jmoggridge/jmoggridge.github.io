# How this website was made with Rstudio + Github

***

## Overview  
<br>
**If you want to make a "your.name.github.io" website with Rstudio like this one, the process if fairly simple**. It helps if you're familiar with Rstudio's Markdown format used in notebooks a bit; if not, this is a good [walk-through](https://seb951.github.io/rmarkdown_workshop/Rmarkdown/rmarkdown_main.html)  

Rstudio has a great variety of tools to analyse, represent and communicate scientific information; 
I'm hoping to leverage these to produce work that is  informative and aesthetic. I'm already a big fan of working in R notebooks and Jupyter so this route felt natural.


There is a tutorial on the Rstudio website about how to do exactly this... but the simplest how-to I found was on [Florian Privé's github](https://github.com/privefl/rmarkdown-website-template#make-your-website-with-r-markdown-in-minutes).  The process involves 'forking' (copying) his templates to editing and adding content in Rstudio, then building the page and pushing it to github.

For more guidance on structuring and Rmarkdown formatting, I learned a lot from [Emily Zabor's site](https://www.emilyzabor.com/tutorials/rmarkdown_websites_tutorial.html#personal_websites)

## Step by step  
***
<br>

###  **First you'll need to install**:
<br>

  +  R and Rstudio (I'm using R v3.6.2 and v1.2)  
  
  +  Git and a Github account  
  
  +  a fewR packages:  
  
      *  to install a package: $ R install.packages("Package_Name_Here")  
  
      *  devtools -> I had to install this when the 'Build' menu only had the 'Configure built tools...' option.  
  
      *  tidyverse  
<br>

<br>

### **Get the template**
***
  


##### **1 -- Go to [Florian Privé's github repository](https://github.com/privefl/rmarkdown-website-template#make-your-website-with-r-markdown-in-minutes).**  Follow his instructions to:

+ Fork his GitHub repository for the webpage to yours

+ Rename the repository it to **yourname**.github.io 
  
+ Once in your github, click ‘Clone’, choose ‘SSH key’ not http. **Copy the key**

  * You might need to create a new SSH key for Git (I did & have included instructions on how to do this below this section; it wasn't hard).
  <br>  
  
  <br>  

##### **2 -- Start a new Rstudio session**
  
  + Open a **new project** from file menu
  
    * Choose **version control**  
  
    * Choose **Git**
  
    * Your repository info should paste itself in automatically now <p>  
  
  + Choose file directory for the website's files & save.
  You should now have all the files you'll need to build the site in your Rstudio environment and they will be downloaded to the specified folder.

<br>  
  
#####  **3 -- Key files** --  *\_site.yml* and *index.Rmd*

  + Open these in the 'files' pane in Rstudio
  
  + **_site.yml** file defines the layout of the site. This is where you can:
  
    * Add your own info to the template
    
    * Set pages themes  
  
    * Add new pages to menus  <p>  <p>
    
    
  + **index.Rmd** is the current frontpage of the site, given the setup in the _site.yml file. The **about.Rmd** is an extra page that is further down in the menu
    
    * These are Rmarkdown documents, you can edit their content and then they will be rendered into html files before you build the website.<p>
    
  *  Once you're done adding and editing, and you want to upload it, save your files, go to the 'Build' tab and click 'Build Website'
  
  
  
<br>  

##### **4 -- Git add, commit and push**
<br>  

There are probably other ways to do this but using terminal is fast and easy.  

* Open a terminal window, set working directory to your project folder

* Enter these commands in (after $):
```
 if you to see a list of Git commands (optional, shows documentation for Git):
 $ git
 
 this adds all the files in the directory to the index
 $ git add .
 
 this records all the changes that were made and labels this version "first build"
 $ git commit -m "first build"
 ```
<br>  
* Now go back to your Rstudio window, to the the 'Git' tab and hit the 'Push" arrow icon.
<br>

### If you need a new SSH key on Github  
<br>
I followed [this tutorial](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) to generate a new SSH key on Github for the first time.

While doing that, you might run into an issue with this if you are on macOS > 10.12. (see next section)
<br>  
  
***
#### Problem for setting SSH key older macs like mine

I get to this step where I need to modify the ‘.ssh/config’ file:
—————
If you're using macOS Sierra 10.12.2 or later, you will need to modify your ~/.ssh/config file to automatically load keys into the ssh-agent and store passphrases in your keychain.

Host *
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  UseKeychain yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ra
—————
** now I’m using OSx10.12.6, so I found a good answer on StackOverflow and do this stuff
    
    Start Terminal and create the ~/.ssh directory if it doesn't exist:
    	> mkdir -p ~/.ssh
    
    Now go into the directory:
    	> cd ~/.ssh
    
    Now open the file config with the default editor:
    	> open -t config
    
    If it says that file doesn't exist, create it with:
    	> touch config
    
    and try opening again:
     	> open -t config
    
    When you edit the file, make sure it is "Plain Text" using the menu at the top of the screen and clicking Format->Make Plain Text.
    Set the permissions as instructed in your tutorial.

Finish that GitHub tut and go to the next page to copy SSH info and add it into Github.
This was fine using this:

	> pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
	# Copies the contents of the id_rsa.pub file to your clipboard


		Ok now I could ‘Clone’ the repository by copying the SSH link
		
		4. The next step is
  
#### **Editing and adding content**

The following is a scratch-pad type record that I keep while making this website,
