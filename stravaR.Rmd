title: "stravaR"

Work in progress! 

I'm working on some python and R code that will get my user data from strava and produce visualizations of certain metrics that I think are difficult to extract from Strava's features.

Some things that I've been messing around with:
  - geographic heatmap layers by other statistics beyond just 'times ridden -> colour'
  - combining other biometric variables over workout data
  - statistics for analysis of grouped user data
  
This **[R package for strava data]~(ADD LINK) is already available and has some very cool functions...
